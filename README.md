inagri is a smart, ML-powered crop recommendation system built during a hackathon to assist farmers and agricultural planners in selecting the most suitable crops for their soil and climatic conditions. This project uses a Kaggle dataset to train a model with over 99% accuracy, and provides an interactive dashboard powered by Google Colab.
